# AI Agent Mastery Course

This repository contains all code and resources for the [AI Agent Mastery course](https://community.dynamous.ai/s/ai-mastery-course/). This course guides you through the full lifecycle of building AI agents - from initial planning all the way to deployment and monetization!

### Quick Start: Get the Complete Agent

**Looking for the final, production-ready agent?**

| What You Need | Module | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Complete Agent** | [`8_Agent_Evals/`](./8_Agent_Evals/) | The full agent with all features, evaluations, and updated packages. **Start here.** |
| **Agent + Monetization** | [`9_Agent_SaaS/`](./9_Agent_SaaS/) | Stripe integration for SaaS monetization. |

Most users should start with Module 8. Only use Module 9 if you specifically want to add Stripe payments and subscription management.

- Example configurations for different use cases
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Local AI and "Cloud" AI implementations

#### Module 4: Building & Coding the Agent
- Pydantic AI code examples for structured AI agent development
- Complete Python implementations of agent components
- Configuration scaffolding to use your agents with any LLMs (local and not local)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation patterns
- Best practices for agent long term memory
- Examples for using your AI agents in a frontend (built with Streamlit)

#### Module 5: Agent Application (Full UI)
- Full-stack application with React frontend and FastAPI backend
- Modern UI with Shadcn components and real-time streaming responses
- Conversation history management and storage
- User session management
- Integration with the Pydantic AI agent from Module 4

### Mock Data for RAG

If you want a collection of documents (Markdown files) for a fake company generated by Claude like I use in the course and on YouTube, feel free to download `Mock_Data_For_RAG.zip` and bring that into your file source for your RAG pipeline.

### How to Use the Course Materials

1. **Select** the module you're currently working on (each folder starts with the module number)
